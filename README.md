## Installation

This proyect doesn't need a specific installation, just download it and open the index file up, just that!. However I strongly recomend using Visual Studio Code with plugins, for a better visualizing experience.

## Usage

```bash
Just open the index.html
```

## Contributing
This proyect is quite simple, and is part of my personal portfolio, so it is not intended to receive contributions.
